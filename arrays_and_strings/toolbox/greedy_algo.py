"""
a greedy algorithm iterates through the problem space taking the optimal
solution 'so far' until it reaches the end

the greedy approach is only optimal if the problem has "optimal structure"
which means stitching together optimal solutions to subproblems yields
and optimal answer

trying out a greedy approach should be one of the first ways you try
to break down a new question!

greedy approaches are great because they're fast
(usually just one pass through the input) but they dont always work

How do you know if a problem will lend itself to greedy approach?
Try it out!

Start by asking: Suppose we could come up with the answer in one pass
through the input, by simply updating the 'best answer so far' as
we went.  What additional values would we need to keep updated as
we looked at each item in our set, in order to be able to update the best answer
so far in constant time?
